# From Interest to Passion: Finding Your True North in Life

Recently, I realized that since I was publishing in a semi-public setting, my articles should be helpful or inspiring to others, and I consciously resisted creating information noise. 

A while ago, stand-up comedian Fu Hang passionately shouted "passion" during his performance in the finals and won the season championship. Suddenly, "passion" became a buzzword in the second half of 2024, frequently appearing in content across major websites and social media platforms in China.

"Passion" translates to "激情" in Chinese. In many contexts, people equate passion with innate talent, indirectly suggesting that passion cannot be changed or cultivated. Sometimes, people also equate passion with a three-minute hot streak—something that comes quickly and goes away just as fast.

In the past week, I have been following Chen Zishun, a technical expert who graduated from a junior college in 2004 and joined Tencent in 2006. He has recently published three consecutive articles outlining key points about job hunting without a resume and career path transitions. He mentioned that Zack Kass, an executive at OpenAI, gave a speech at Fudan University emphasizing "study what you are passionate about" (full transcript link in the appendix). This aligns perfectly with his long-held views and the main themes of his three articles.

Returning to the word "passion" itself, it is not very common in Chinese personal development books. However, a similar word, "interest," is much more widely known. There are countless slang terms and idioms related to interests.

Compared to interest, passion is stronger and more enduring. People with passion can work tirelessly and give their all, ultimately achieving outstanding results (as discussed in "The 10,000-Hour Genius Theory" by Daniel Coyle).

It is worth noting that, like interest, passion is not a skill in itself. Possessing it does not directly help us solve problems.

Furthermore, passion requires curiosity, deliberate practice, time, and is accompanied by pain. Therefore, to find your passion, you need to achieve the following five points:

1. Follow your inner curiosity or impulses to try new things
2. Step out of your comfort zone and place yourself in an environment where you can engage with more things you are interested in
3. Allow yourself to fail and keep striving
4. Engage in deliberate practice with a plan
5. Find a sense of meaning in what you do (summarized from Susan Kuang's "I Want to Live This Kind of Life").
   
Striving to discover your passion or True North leads to a life that is meaningful to yourself.

Five or six years ago, when I was still using Weibo, I followed a girl with tens of thousands of followers who transitioned from a white-collar job to painting. Her paintings were well-colored and quite abstract. That was the first time I encountered a real-life story of a life shift or what you might call a life reboot.

At that time, I never imagined that one day I would replan my life from the perspective of passion and interest. Not too early, not too late—now is the perfect moment.
